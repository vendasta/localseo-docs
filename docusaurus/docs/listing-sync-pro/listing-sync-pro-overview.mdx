## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>How does Listing Sync Pro differ from Citation Builder?</summary>

- Listing Sync Pro syncs a business name, address, phone number, and website to 40+ listing sites, with most updating instantly.
- citation builder syncs the same information to three major data providers (TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze and Foursquare). Those providers are referenced by 300+ directories that update at their own intervals, typically over about three weeks.
- in short: Listing Sync Pro provides quicker (often instant) updates to a focused network, while citation builder distributes data across a wider network over time.
