## Why are there no results in the Local SEO Grid?

If the business is a Service Area Business (SAB), the issue might arise from a misalignment between targeted keywords and the address listed in the business profile.

How the map works:

- The listed business address is the center point for the map area used in Local Grid searches.
- If targeted keywords correspond to a region far from the listed address, no rankings will appear in the grid.

Workarounds:

1. Align keywords with the business address by focusing on the area surrounding the listed address.
2. Change the business address to a location closer to the targeted region. Important: This is not recommended and may impact listing accuracy.
