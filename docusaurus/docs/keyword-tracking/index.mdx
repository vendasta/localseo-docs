## Why are there no results in the Local SEO grid?

If the business is a Service Area Business (SAB), the issue might arise from a misalignment between targeted keywords and the address listed in the business profile.

How the map works:

- The listed business address is the center point for the map area used in Local Grid searches.
- If targeted keywords correspond to a region far from the listed address, no rankings will appear in the grid.

Workarounds:

1. Align keywords with the business address by focusing on the area surrounding the listed address.
2. Change the business address to a location closer to the targeted region. Important: This is not recommended and may impact listing accuracy.

### Additional context about keyword mapping
For Google Maps results, the system retrieves a maximum of 20 listings per search. If a business does not rank within the top 20 for an area, it appears as a blank red entry on the map. Organic search results do not use a radius setting. To get more detail, adjust the zoom level to focus on a smaller area.
