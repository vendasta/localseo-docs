# My Listing

The My Listing feature in Local SEO allows businesses to create a customizable online business profile that showcases their business information, services, and other important details. This section provides information on how to create, customize, and analyze your My Listing page.

## What is My Listing?

My Listing lets you create a customizable online business profile that showcases business information, services, and other details. You can choose a theme, add branding, customize the domain, create pages, and track engagement through event analytics.

## Why is My Listing important?

- Present essential business information in one place
- Use responsive themes that adapt to different screen sizes
- Customize branding and domain to match your needs
- Track how visitors interact with your listing

## Whatâ€™s included with My Listing?

- **Business Profile**: Complete the profile that powers your listing content
- **Themes**: Choose a responsive layout
- **Branding**: Upload logo, favicon, and mobile shortcut icons
- **Domains**: Use a custom slug, custom domain, or mobile subdomain
- **Pages**: Create and manage pages such as Images, Contact, Coupons, Videos, and Custom
- **Home Page**: Edit title, content, and metadata
- **Event Analytics**: Track visitor actions such as viewing hours, map, contact info, and more

## How to create and customize your listing

### 1) enter business information
Open `Local SEO` > `My Listing` > `Manage My Listing` > `Business Profile` and complete the profile. The information you enter will appear on the listing.

### 2) select a theme
Go to `My Listing` > `Themes` to select the listing style. The `My Listing` Page theme is the default and is responsive. `Responsive` will adapt to different screen sizes, while `Short Mobile` or `Tall Mobile` are designed primarily for smartphones.

### 3) customize the branding
Upload your `logo`, `favicon`, and `iPhone/Android Shortcut Icon`.

If the business is home-based or service-based, you can select the information you want to hide from the listing.

If you upload a `background image`, ensure it meets the specified size. Background images appear only when the device matches the corresponding size. On other screens, the background color displays instead.

### 4) customize the domain

There are three ways to customize the URL of your listing:

1. **Custom Slug**: Keep the listing on your Local SEO domain but customize the end of the URL (the slug).
   - Go to `My Listing` > `Manage My Listing` > `Domains`.
   - In `Edit Slug`, enter the text that should appear after the root domain. Replace spaces with dashes.
   - Cost: Free

2. **Custom Domain**: Use your listing as the main website (for example, `www.mybusiness.com`).
   - You will need to add TXT and A record entries in your DNS settings.

3. **Custom Domain on mobile subdomain**: Use your listing as the mobile site (for example, desktop at `mybusiness.com`, listing at `m.mybusiness.com`).
   - You will need to add TXT and CNAME entries in your DNS settings.

### 5) update the home page
Go to `My Listing` > `Pages` and click `Edit` beside the `Home` page.

Fill in the fields as you want them to display on the site.

- Although `Meta Keywords` are not commonly used by larger search engines, you can enter site keywords separated by commas.
- `Meta Description` is the two lines of text that appear below a site in web search. Limit to 155 characters and write a descriptive, keyword-rich summary. Each page should have a unique description.

### 6) create additional pages
Click a page type to create a new page:

- `Images`: Create gallery-like pages for the website
- `Contact`: Create a page for visitors to contact the business
- `Coupons`: Create a page dedicated to promotion coupons (set start, end, and expiry dates, and select an image for each coupon)
- `Videos`: Create a videos page where you can embed videos from online video hosts
- `Custom`: Create pages that are not covered by the other categories
