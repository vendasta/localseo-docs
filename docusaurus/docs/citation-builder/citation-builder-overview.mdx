## How data submission works

### Information sent to aggregators
- Primary data submitted to both aggregators includes: Business name, address, city, state/province/region, country, zip/postal code, phone number, and website.
- Additional data (accepted by some sources): Hours of operation, payment methods, business description, services, brands, keywords, landmark, and toll-free number.
- Healthcare records (where applicable): Firm/clinic/office name, first name, last name, email, professional credential, NPI, gender, insurances accepted, and school.

### Aggregator verification
- Aggregators compare submitted data against authoritative sources (for example, postal records). They may make formatting adjustments and may contact businesses for verification.

### Aggregator specifics
#### TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze
- Collects, verifies, and distributes business data to directories, search engines, navigation tools, mobile apps, and more.
- Tracks acceptance and distribution, including reporting to several key platforms.

#### Foursquare

- Distributes business data to platforms that rely on Foursquare.

### Verification examples
- Neustar/Localeze may send a conflict-resolution email when a listing is already claimed. If approved, control is transferred; if not, updates cannot be applied; if no response within 10 business days, the listing is released.

### Toll-free numbers
- Toll-free numbers are supported. Neustar/Localeze has a dedicated field for toll-free numbers.
- To use a toll-free number as the main phone, a standard number must also be provided. Acceptance as a primary number is not always guaranteed.

### Selecting the correct category
- Choosing the correct business category or taxonomy ID ensures accurate classification and helps avoid syncing issues with sources that do not support generic categories.

## Reporting

- View total citations created since activation and new citations added over time.
- See distribution by source in the “View all citations” area.
- Review syncing status and accuracy of name, address, and phone number across platforms.

## Update timeline and expectations

- Submission typically occurs within 24 hours of data entry.
- Aggregators may confirm acceptance within 6–8 weeks.
- Aggregators then share information with citation sources, which may take 2–3 months to publish updates (varies by source).
- Search engines and directories pick up changes on their own refresh cycles.
