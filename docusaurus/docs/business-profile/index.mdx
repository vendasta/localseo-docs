   ![Tone options like friendly, professional, witty](./img/ai-business-desc-tone-options.jpg)

### Long description syndication to Google Business Profile
The `Long Description` field in `Business Profile` > `Marketing` syncs to a connected Google Business Profile when sync is on. If this field contains content, it will be published to the connected profile. If blank, no changes are made.

![Long Description field](./img/9945352259991.jpg)

Recommendations:

- Describe services or products, history/values, and essential details a customer should know.
- Keep content under 750 characters and avoid URLs or HTML.

### Set hours of operation (including past midnight)
1. Open `Business Profile` and go to the `Hours` tab.
2. Enter your hours, including ranges that extend past midnight (for example, `11:00 am - 3:00 am`).
   
   ![Configuring hours that extend past midnight](./img/business-hours-operation.jpg)

:::warning
Changes to hours typically occur quickly, but in some cases can take 3–5 days to sync to Google. Plan updates accordingly.
:::

### Manage special hours and Google attributes
- `Special Hours` are under the `Hours` tab and are ideal for holidays and exceptions to your regular hours.
- Category-specific Google attributes are under the `More` tab. Available attributes vary by business category.

### Set primary and additional categories
Categories help directories classify your business. The first category sent is treated as the primary category. Additional categories may sync to listing networks that support them. Keep categories aligned across the product to avoid sync failures on category‑sensitive networks.

### Use more hours
All users can access `More Hours` from the `Business Profile` tab.
1. In `Business Profile`, open the `Hours` tab to view and manage `More Hours`.
2. Add category-specific hours such as delivery, drive-through, takeout, or pick-up.

:::info
This syncing field is available in the `Business Profile` tab. You can find the remainder of business data in the account management area.
:::

### Hide your physical address (service area businesses)
You can list your business as a service area business and hide the physical address in Listing Sync Pro, Citation Builder, and in Listings Grade in the Snapshot Report. This improves accuracy for businesses that operate without a public storefront. It also improves the accuracy of your listing score and the listing grade in the snapshot report.

:::warning
Some listing sources do not support hidden addresses. This may reduce the number of available sources to sync. It does not negatively affect your listing score.
:::

#### Set during new account creation
1. In the `Business Profile` section of account creation, check `Service Area Business (hide physical address)` (below `Zip/Postal Code`). It is off by default.
